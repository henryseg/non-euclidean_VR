# non-euclidean_VR

Non-euclidean VR (Nil branch)

Based on the ray marching hyperbolic virtual reality simulation (for mobile devices) by Henry Segerman and Michael Woodard at https://github.com/mtwoodard/hypVR-Ray_m,
which is in turn based on the full simulation at https://github.com/mtwoodard/hypVR-Ray. 

We plan to make this version as independent of the underlying geometry as possible, so that we can convert it to simulate other geometries, e.g. the other eight Thurston geometries.

This project started at the Illustrating Mathematics semester program at ICERM (https://icerm.brown.edu)
